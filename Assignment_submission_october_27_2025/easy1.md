Easy 1: Describe the key concept of Pandas Fundamentals


Pandas is a Python library that provides powerful, easy-to-use data structures like Series (1D labeled arrays) and DataFrame (2D labeled tables). It helps perform data cleaning, transformation, filtering, and aggregation efficiently. Pandas allows you to handle missing data, perform group operations, merge datasets, and reshape data for analysis — all with concise, readable syntax.

I started by exploring Pandas’ core data structures (Series and DataFrame) and their key operations like indexing, filtering, and summarization. I focused on understanding how Pandas simplifies data manipulation compared to using raw Python lists or dictionaries.
