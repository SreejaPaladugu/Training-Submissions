Easy 1: Describe the key concept of Python Data Structures in your own words.

Python data structures are ways to organize, store, and manage data efficiently for performing operations like searching, inserting, updating, or deleting. The primary built-in data structures are lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items.

Tuples are ordered but immutable, suitable for fixed data.

Sets store unique, unordered items useful for membership tests and removing duplicates.

Dictionaries hold key–value pairs for fast lookups.
