NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computations. Its core feature is the ndarray, which is a fast, memory-efficient, multidimensional array for storing and operating on homogeneous data. NumPy allows vectorized operations, meaning mathematical operations can be applied to entire arrays at once without explicit loops. It also provides tools for linear algebra, statistics, reshaping arrays, and working with large datasets efficiently.

Key points:

Arrays (ndarray) are faster and more efficient than Python lists.

Vectorized operations avoid explicit loops.

Supports mathematical, logical, and statistical operations.

Handles large datasets with optimized memory usage.
