 **Easy 1: Describe the key concept of Python Basics & Setup**

**Answer:**

Python Basics & Setup is all about getting started with Python the right way — by first setting up your system and then learning the simple building blocks of the language. It’s like preparing your workspace before you begin creating something new.

To begin, I installed Python on my Windows computer by visiting the official website [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads) and downloading the latest version. During installation, I made sure to check the box **“Add Python to PATH”** so it could run from anywhere on my computer. After installation, I opened the **Command Prompt** and typed `python --version` to confirm it was correctly installed. Then, I installed **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as my code editor and added the **Python extension** to make writing and running code easier.

Once everything was set up, I tested it by creating a small program named `hello.py` and wrote:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Running this program printed the message successfully — confirming my environment was ready.

Next, I explored the basics of Python:

**Variables** for storing data (`x = 10`)
**Data types** like numbers, strings, and lists
**Conditional statements** (`if`, `else`) for decision-making
**Loops** (`for`, `while`) to repeat actions
**Functions** to organize reusable code

Learning these fundamentals helped me understand how Python “thinks” and how I can use it to solve everyday problems. This setup and practice built the foundation for all my upcoming work in Python.
